# Code editors

A code editor is the place where programmers spend most of their time.

There are two archetypes: IDE and lightweight editors. Many people feel comfortable choosing one tool of each type.

## IDE

The term [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (Integrated Development Environment) means a powerful editor with many features that usually operates on a "whole project." As the name suggests, that's not just an editor, but a full-scale "development environment."

An IDE loads the project (can be many files), allows navigation between files, provides autocompletion based on the whole project (not just the open file), integrates with a version management system (like [git](https://git-scm.com/)), a testing environment and other "project-level" stuff.

If you haven't considered selecting an IDE yet, look at the following variants:

- [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for frontend development and other editors of the same company if you need additional languages (paid).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free).
- [Netbeans](http://netbeans.org/) (paid).

All of the IDEs are cross-platform.

For Windows, there's also a "Visual Studio" editor, don't confuse it with "Visual Studio Code." "Visual Studio" is a paid and mighty Windows-only editor, well-suited for the .NET platform. A free version of it is called ([Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)).

Many IDEs are paid but have a trial period. Their cost is usually negligible compared to a qualified developer's salary, so just choose the best one for you.

## Lightweight editors

"Lightweight editors" are not as powerful as IDEs, but they're fast, elegant and simple.

They are mainly used to open and edit a file instantly.

The main difference between a "lightweight editor" and an "IDE" is that an IDE works on a project-level, so it loads much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.

In practice, lightweight editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and autocompleters, so there's no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.

The following options deserve your attention:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (cross-platform, free).
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (cross-platform, free).
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) (cross-platform, shareware).
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows, free).
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) are also cool if you know how to use them.

## My favorites

The personal preference of the author is to have both an IDE for projects and a lightweight editor for quick and easy file editing.

I'm using:

- [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for JS, and if there is one more language in the project, then I switch to one of the other JetBrains offerings listed above.
- As a lightweight editor -- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).

## Let's not argue

The editors in the lists above are those that either I or my friends whom I consider good developers have been using for a long time and are happy with.

There are other great editors in our big world. Please choose the one you like the most.

The choice of an editor, like any other tool, is individual and depends on your projects, habits, personal preferences.
